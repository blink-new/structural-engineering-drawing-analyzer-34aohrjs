# Structural Engineering Drawing Analyzer - Design Document

## Overview
The Structural Engineering Drawing Analyzer is a specialized application for structural engineers and construction professionals. It allows users to upload structural engineering drawings, automatically analyze and identify steel elements within those drawings, highlight the elements on the drawings, link them to a bill of materials, and export all this information to an Excel file.

## Core Features

### 1. Drawing Upload and Management
- Drag-and-drop interface for uploading engineering drawings
- Support for common file formats (PDF, PNG, JPEG, DXF, etc.)
- Drawing preview with zoom and pan capabilities
- Drawing management (rename, delete, organize)

### 2. Drawing Analysis
- Automated detection of steel elements using image recognition
- Element classification by type (beams, columns, braces, etc.)
- Dimensional analysis (length, width, depth)
- Quantity calculation

### 3. Interactive Drawing Visualization
- Interactive highlighting of identified elements on the drawing
- Color-coding based on element type or other attributes
- Ability to toggle highlights on/off
- Manual correction/annotation capabilities

### 4. Bill of Materials (BOM) Management
- Automatic generation of BOM from analyzed drawings
- Direct linkage between drawing elements and BOM entries
- Editing capabilities for BOM entries
- Summaries and totals (weights, quantities, costs)

### 5. Export Functionality
- Export of complete analysis to Excel file
- Customizable export templates
- Include images in export (annotated drawings)
- PDF report generation

## User Interface Design

### Layout
The application will have a modern, clean interface inspired by professional engineering software with Vercel-like aesthetics:

1. **Header** - Logo, navigation, user controls
2. **Main Content Area** - Context-dependent display area
3. **Side Panel** - Tools, controls, and information relevant to current task
4. **Status Bar** - Process status, notifications

### Key Screens

#### 1. Dashboard/Upload Screen
- Project overview
- Recent drawings
- Upload area
- Quick actions

#### 2. Drawing Analysis View
- Drawing preview with pan/zoom controls
- Element highlighting overlay
- Analysis controls
- Element information sidebar

#### 3. Bill of Materials View
- Tabular view of all identified elements
- Filtering and sorting options
- Edit capabilities
- Direct links to highlighted elements in drawings

#### 4. Export Configuration Screen
- Export format options
- Template selection
- Customization controls
- Export preview

## Technical Approach

### Front-end
- React with TypeScript for UI components
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Canvas API for drawing manipulation and highlighting
- Libraries for file handling and image processing

### Data Processing
- Client-side image processing for basic analysis
- Potential integration with specialized libraries for engineering drawings
- For more advanced analysis, future versions could leverage cloud-based ML services

### State Management
- React Context API for application state
- Local storage for persisting user preferences and recent projects
- IndexedDB for client-side storage of drawings and analysis results

### Data Export
- Libraries for Excel file generation (SheetJS/xlsx)
- PDF generation libraries for reports

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core UI and Upload Functionality
- Complete application layout
- Implement file upload and drawing preview
- Basic drawing management

### Phase 2: Drawing Analysis and Visualization
- Implement basic element detection
- Add highlighting functionality
- Create interactive annotation tools

### Phase 3: Bill of Materials Integration
- Develop BOM generation
- Create linkage between drawings and BOM
- Implement BOM editing capabilities

### Phase 4: Export Functionality
- Add Excel export feature
- Implement customizable export templates
- Add report generation

## Limitations and Future Considerations

- The initial version will focus on client-side processing, which may limit the complexity of drawings that can be analyzed
- Advanced pattern recognition may require future integration with specialized services
- The accuracy of automated detection will be continuously improved in future versions
